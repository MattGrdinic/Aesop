Basic Help For Running Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run compiled code we first select an application from the 'Application list'

Simply click on the application name to 'select' that app. 

When we do this the 'Basic Server Settings' tab will populate with 
any values already set for this app, or have several blank fields if this is 
the first time the app has been selected.

Please note that if this is the first time we've selected the application 
it will not run until we set a few of its options... 

Thus, we can run applications using 1 of 2 main modes:

1. Non-HDF
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this mode we rely on the settings provided in the 'Basic Server Settings'
tab. We must provide the basics, which means:

Application Path Name - this is set automatically
Executable Name - This will (usually) be the same as the application path name
Server Port - 8080 is a good default if running in non-root mode.
Server Admin Port - 8088 is a good default choice.

All other fields are optional, but it is advised to provide values.

For example, 'Server Source Root' is used to tell HPHP where image, css, js, and 
all other site files are located. This means when we selected an application to 
compile we selected the 'source root' of the site. HPHP then went in and
grabbed all the PHP files of the site and compiled them.

What HPHP didn't do (or Aesop for that matter), is collect all other files
which were not *.php. This means if the site has images, css, js, and anything else,
we need to tell our compiled web app where those guys are.

Thus, we select that same source root as we did when we told HPHP where the .php 
files where, which has the effect then of saying, "here are the images, css, etc."

2. HDF
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can also use an HDF file to control the server settings.

This is required if we want to have more precise control over the server.

For example, an HDF file allows us to set up virtual hosts, as well
as rewrite rules. We can learn more about the possible HDF file settings at:

https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/Runtime-options


All applications are provided with a 'stock' HDF file during the compilation
process. Thus, if we click the 'Detailed Server Settings (HDF File) tab the text 
box will populate with a slew of values.

However, please note that we do not use HDF mode unless we click back to the
first tab (Basic Server Settings) and select 'Use The Custom HDF File For This Server'
under 'Server Configuration Mode'.

We can update the text of the HDF file at any time, just be sure to click: 'Save HDF File'
to apply any changes for the next server start.


Running Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we've decided upon a run mode we provide settings as described above we can now safely 
click the 'Start Application' button. If the server starts successfully we'll see 
a number printed to the second column of the 'Application List', the process ID of the server.

We can now select other applications and perform the same steps, the existing server will 
continue to run until an error occurs (not likely), or we select the app again and click 
'Stop Application'.

In other words, we can manage we apps running on the server like any other tasks. We can have 
multiple servers running at the same time, provided we use virtual hosts or set unique 
ports for each server instance. 

Please note that at this time only 'Standard Web Server' and 'Deamon' are supported Server Modes.
