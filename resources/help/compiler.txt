How to Compile Code:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, Select the projects base directory using the 'Select Project Folder' button.

The base directory is the 'root' of the web site. 

When we do this Aesop will create a list of .php files it has found and display them 
in the 'File List' tab. This list cannot be changed, but rarely needs to be.

Next, we name the project/executable under 'Project/Executable Name'. 

Now select the proper 'Build Mode'.

'Analyze' will check code for errors and display the result in: 'Compiler Output'.
'Run (Compile Full Program)' will start the full HPHP compiler.

Press 'Compile Code' and get comfortable. This step can take a while. 

You will see the text: 'compiling and linking CPP files...' as the last line
in the 'Compiler Output' screen. This will continue to be the last line 
while the compiler runs. The screen will automatically update if errors are
output or when the compiler process finishes. 

With this step done we now have a fully compiled app which has been placed in:

Aesop/compiled-web-apps

We needn't bother knowing this location however, as Aesop tracks our apps in the 
'Run Compiled Code' tab. 


==Tips and Tricks==


Tip 1 - HipHop will fail if we have duplicate folder names with PHP files in them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This may seem like a rare occurance, but think about a normal site
that may have many subdirectories -- it is not at all uncommon to have a site with 
a legacy /database directory in several locations for example.

The key is the folder has to have .php files in it for this failure to occur.
If it just has say, image files, the issue will not arise. 

Tip 2 - Compiling applications takes a while. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
20 minutes or so for larger apps like WordPress.
Even a simple single test page will take about a minute.

Thus, patience is key!
